I believe nobody knows how astonishing browser games can be, how challenging and complicated is to develop it. At Evolution we focus on creating the most accessible and immersive experience for our players using WebGL and WebXR!

### Intro 
If you are guessing what is this topic about let me introduce myself first :)

My name is Mikhail Ilin. I work in Evolution Engineering as a frontend developer. We are the leading "casino as a service” provider in a whole world. So we will talk about web browsers :) 

### First blood: from DOOM to browser

But let me first share something more personal.

My first experience with 3D video games happened when I was 8 years old. It was my dad’s workplace where I first time played DOOM.

This cover art exactly describes what I felt seating infront of 14 inch CRT display with Sound Blaster and stereo speakers.

I never forget this feeling of walking through the labyrinths full of scary species. Yes, I was really scared! 8 years old! The terrifying sounds, the blood is everywhere, these monsters from scariest nightmares I could never dream about.

I have never experienced anything like that before. Ofcourse now it looks very simple looking. But at that time… 

My second overwhelming experience happend to me almost 20 years later when the first oculus VR headset was released. Actually it was the early adopters developer kit: it has a lots of gear needed to setup, the screen resolution was very low, but there were already plenty of games and demoes to got the idea that future is here.

You may be surprised if I tell you that the next time I were astonished was when I learned about games in Evolution two years ago. At that time I already had many years of web development experience behind. I worked with ReactJS, I knew about video streaming services, I played with 3D graphics a bit. But I couldn’t imagine how far people can go in their passion to engineering stuff.
