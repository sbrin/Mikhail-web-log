I love to make small but useful things. All of the [stuff I made recently](/stuff/) was made with the idea that it should be done easy with a minimum hustle. If the project needs days of research and hours of preparations to just run the proof of concept I would never finish it. "Keep it simple" is the key here. For that reason I started to follow the "no build" philosophy â€” when you can run your app straight away without any build or deploy stages.

## Principles

- it is made to run locally
- no need for internet connection
- everything can be stored in one .zip archive
- deployment is just copying files or pushing to git
- no virtualization needed
