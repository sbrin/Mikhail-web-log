summary: I've decided to move forward towards my dream of passive income, fame, and recognition for creating something useful. At the same time, I'm studying how startups are made and going through the founder's journey. So I won't limit myself to just Flipper. Now it's a universal graphics editor for low-resolution screens on outdated chips ü§° Meet Lopaka...

**The problem**: it is tiring to create a beautiful interface for electronic devices.

**The solution**: a cross-platform graphic editor with a code builder and component library. Supports popular GUI libraries: U8g2, Adafruit GFX, Flipper Zero canvas API, embedded-graphics under Rust, LVGL, and more. Accessible from any device and OS via a web application, collaborative work, prototyping, and everything else that Figma is loved for.

My cursory analysis of existing solutions did not yield results: I found only one editor close in functionality (SquareLine) and it is ten years behind and only works with LVGL. Everything else is poor makeshift versions that need to be downloaded, configured, and installed - in general, it is a real headache. For u8g2, there is nothing like it at all.

### Meet Lopaka with U8g2 and Arduino graphics!

I've added support for the most popular library for monochrome displays, [u8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2), created a new repository, and bought a beautiful domain.
